> Give the model's answers a face — the text is still there, and an interactive UI is already live.

> 🎯 A fork of [`omdsh-dev/dsh-genui`](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-genui) that fuses **ECharts** and **Flint** into the `dsh-ui` fence vocabulary: the model can now render interactive data charts (bar / line / pie / heatmap / anything ECharts draws) inline, either by writing a raw ECharts `option` or a declarative Flint `ChartAssemblyInput` that the client compiles to ECharts.

The model no longer just answers in text. Install this plugin, ask "how are this month's orders doing", and it renders a **clickable data panel** right inside the answer as it analyzes: watch trends, drag sliders, hit refresh — and the model actually responds.

## ⚠️ Read this first: dual-channel rendering (no host source patch required)

The plugin ships **two rendering channels** and picks one automatically after the host activates its browser module:

- **Registry channel**: when the host exposes the `fence-registry` extension point (newer dsh builds), fences register through the host's streaming render pipeline and behave seamlessly with the host;
- **DOM channel**: when the host lacks that extension point (including stock DSH and older builds), the plugin observes the session DOM and mounts its own render tree. Since 0.7.2 it **supports streaming rendering**: components appear as the model writes them — the first finished component shows up immediately, no need to wait for the whole reply. Since 0.8.3 fence discovery is **multi-surface**: it matches the stock `md-code-block` surface, the deepsuite-style `.code-block` / `.code-block-small` surfaces some host builds render instead, and — as a structural backstop — any element whose banner labels it `dsh-ui` and contains a `<pre>` body. If your dsh build renders fences with a different class name, they still render (and a one-time console warning tells you the host DOM drifted).

Whichever channel is active, components, interactions, panels, and persistence behave identically.

The repository ships both renderer channels, the host plugin, and the built browser bundle. The host still owns **client activation** and must provide the `slots` and `sessions` services. A downloaded `client.js` or a ModuleLoader cache entry proves only that bytes arrived — successful activation always prints `[genui] client active; fence-channel=registry|dom`. If that line is absent, fix package/profile identity or host activation first; DOM attributes such as `data-streaming` and `data-chat-anchor-key` are optional fallbacks, not installation prerequisites.

## ✨ Before vs. after

| Plain answer | With dsh-genui-charts |
|---|---|
| "Revenue this month: ¥128,430, +12.4% MoM — watch the conversion rate." | One line of analysis + three stat cards (revenue / orders / conversion), a trend chart, and a progress bar rendered right beside it |
| Want to see more? Type another question. | The panel already has "Refresh" / "Switch view" buttons — click, and the model updates the data |

## 🚀 Quick start

Prerequisites — all required:

1. **dsh installed** (any open-source build works — the plugin picks its rendering channel at startup, see "dual-channel rendering" above)
2. **`pnpm` on your PATH**: the `dsh plugin` command depends on it. If missing: `corepack enable` (or `npm i -g pnpm`), then **open a new terminal** and confirm `pnpm -v` prints a version

Install (one command, all dependencies included):

```sh
# Local source install (this fork lives in a local checkout)
dsh plugin --profile web add link:/path/to/dsh-genui-charts
```

> ⚠️ **Don't use `link:` on a freshly cloned directory without building first** — `link:` does not install the plugin's dependencies (mermaid / three / echarts / flint-chart / react), and the `lib/` build output is NOT committed (`pnpm build` emits it). Run `pnpm install && pnpm build` in the checkout before `link:`-installing. See "Developer iteration (link mode)" below.

Restart dsh web + hard refresh, then in a new session say "use dsh-ui to draw a stats dashboard" to verify.

### One-click script (recommended)

After cloning, just run it — the script checks the prerequisites above, performs the install, and prompts you to restart:

```sh
git clone <this repo>
cd dsh-genui-charts
./scripts/install.sh
```

### Developer iteration (link mode)

```sh
cd dsh-genui-charts
pnpm install
pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add link:$PWD
```

## 🧩 What it can do

- **Answer-as-UI**: components are embedded in the reply and appear as they stream — no waiting for the whole message
- **30+ components**: cards, tables, charts, forms, tabs, accordions, file trees, timelines, diffs…
- **Native media**: audio and video play inline from browser-reachable http(s) or same-origin relative URLs, with user-controlled playback, video posters/aspect ratios, and visible failure states
- **Function plots**: `plot` draws curves; parameter sliders redraw in real time, with optional auto-animation

</p>

- **ECharts charts** (this fork): `{"type":"echarts","option":{...}}` renders any ECharts chart (bar / line / pie / scatter / heatmap / sankey …) with hover tooltips and zoom. The `option` is deep-sanitized — function-valued `formatter`/`renderItem` fields are stripped, so no script ever reaches the DOM.
- **Flint charts** (this fork): `{"type":"flint","input":{...}}` takes a declarative Flint `ChartAssemblyInput` (`chartType` + `encodings` + `semantic_types` + bound `data.values`), compiles it to an ECharts option client-side via `flint-chart/echarts`, and renders it. Semantic types (Amount / Percentage / Date / Category …) drive axis formatting, zero-baseline, and color scales automatically.

- **Quiz**: `quiz` grades on click with explanation and retry; with `action`, the answer is also sent back to the model (grading stays local and instant)
- **Local grading (submit)**: a multiple-choice set = one `radio` per question with `group` + `answer` (correct answer) + `explanation`, plus one `submit` button — after the user answers everything and clicks once, **the score, per-question right/wrong, and explanations appear right in the UI with zero model round-trips**; the quiz then locks, and "retake" resets locally (optional `resetAction` notifies the model). Questions without an answer fall back to an aggregated action (`fields` collects every input with an `id`)
- **State persistence**: answers, submission locks, and input values are saved per "session + content fingerprint" — refresh or reopen restores everything; re-rendering identical content keeps user state; new content starts fresh; LRU cap of 200 blocks
- **Form semantics**: `input` Enter / `textarea` Ctrl+Enter submits immediately (`submit:true`), no blur needed; fields with an `id` are collected into the submit's `fields`
- **Secrets ban**: GenUI must never ask for passwords, API keys, access tokens, recovery codes, or other secrets; even if a password input appears, it stays masked, is never persisted, and never enters form collection
- **Local-first principle**: state changes the UI can do itself (grading, quiz checking, resets, expand/collapse, selection) always happen locally and instantly; actions are reserved for things that genuinely need the model (generating new content, running tools, next-step suggestions)
- **Honest interactions**: interactive components must carry `action`; buttons without one render disabled (kills the "looks clickable, does nothing" fake button); buttons with `action` show instant "triggered" local feedback (proof the local event fired, not that the model received it)
- **Event loop**: buttons/switches/inputs/dropdowns/checkboxes/radios/textareas/quizzes carry `action`; click or blur sends back to the model, which updates the UI; same-name actions are debounced with a 300 ms trailing edge — rapid clicks merge into one (last value wins)
- **Tool channel**: the `render_ui` tool renders the same spec as a card in the tool row (deliverable-style UI goes through the tool, answer-style UI through the fence)
- **Session panel**: a persistent dock above the composer; `render_ui` / `panel: true` fences update the same surface in place; `/panel` opens it from the client (`/panel <instruction>` customizes via the model, `/panel clear` clears); the top border is draggable to resize; `append: true` merges incrementally — same-named tabs append content, new tabs get added; the whole panel caps at 200 nodes / 200 appends, after which the model should send `replace` to rebuild
- **Self-healing & limits**: every fence passes a spec guard — bad nodes are silently dropped, numbers clamped, strings truncated; the whole tree is capped at 200 nodes / 8 nesting levels; pathological specs never crash the UI
- **Chart error self-healing**: mermaid failures auto-retry with repairs (strip backticks, quote Chinese/space labels, remove `<br/>`) before degrading to source; a broken chart never hits the screen
- **Accessibility**: tabs/accordions/switches/progress bars carry full ARIA and keyboard navigation (arrow keys switch tabs, Home/End jump)
- **Zero intrusion**: without the plugin, fences are just code blocks — no errors, no session pollution

Component JSON syntax: [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) (also copyable to `~/.dsh/skills/genui/` to boost the model).

## 📄 Example

The model outputs this fence (written for the browser — you don't need to read it):

```dsh-ui
{"title":"Order overview","items":[
  {"type":"stat","label":"Total revenue","value":"¥128,430","delta":"+12.4%"},
  {"type":"stat","label":"Orders","value":"1,024","delta":"-3.1%"}
]}
```

What you see: two stat cards.

## 🔧 How it works

The model writes the interface description as JSON inside a `dsh-ui` fence; the browser-side renderer (`src/client`) claims this language through the main repo's `fence-registry` interface and renders it. Components are whitelisted — the model can't smuggle in HTML/scripts; function expressions go through a standalone parser, never `eval`.

The core render package stays light (≈110 KB min / 28 KB gzip); the mermaid, three.js, echarts, and flint engines are bundled separately as on-demand assets (loaded through the plugin's self-registered HTTP routes the first time they're used), so startup only downloads the rendering core.

## ❓ FAQ

- **Rendering as a code block?** First check the browser console for `[genui] client active; fence-channel=registry|dom`. If absent, the client bundle was not activated even if its URL returns 200 — align the profile dependency, `package.json.name`, `cordis.patch.yml`, ModuleLoader id, and configured bundle name. If present, inspect the fence label/body; registry-less hosts automatically use the DOM channel.
- **Chat UI goes blank when rendering a dsh-ui fence?** Your dsh is too old — update dsh first, then reinstall the plugin.
- **`dsh: pnpm not found on PATH`?** Install pnpm, then **open a new terminal** and retry (`corepack enable` or `npm i -g pnpm`).
- **Stuck on git credentials / 404 during install?** The repo is public (`omdsh-dev/dsh-genui` upstream); this fork is local — install via `link:` (see Quick start).
- **Installed but scene3d/mermaid/echarts/flint don't render?** The engines (mermaid / three / echarts / flint) are no longer inlined in client.js — they load on demand the first time they're used (`/plugins/dsh-genui-charts/assets/*.js`, hosted by the plugin's own HTTP routes). First restart dsh web + hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R); still broken, remove and reinstall (`dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-genui-charts`, then add again). Hosts without the asset routes degrade to source/load-error hints — update dsh.
- **Model not outputting fences?** New sessions pick it up after a restart; or just say "output it with dsh-ui".
- **No lib/ after cloning?** Build it yourself: `pnpm install && pnpm run check`.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check   # type check + full tests + build
```

### Real-device e2e

The real chain end to end: start a temporary dsh web → install the plugin → send a message in a browser so the model outputs a `dsh-ui` fence → assert the rendering → click an action button → assert the model responds (event-loop closure):

```sh
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-... node scripts/e2e.mjs          # link-installs the current workspace
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-... node scripts/e2e.mjs --install git   # friend path (git URL)
```

Prereqs: `dsh`/`pnpm` on PATH, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, and the main repo's web build output (playwright resolves it from the main repo). On PASS it saves an `e2e-final.png` screenshot.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (evaluated)

| Direction | Verdict | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Incremental patching (model sends diffs, not full specs) | Not doing | A fence costs 200–800 tokens; resending is nearly free; a patch protocol's teaching cost and error rate aren't worth it. Revisit if sub-second auto-refreshing panels ever appear |
| Action debounce/dedup | ✅ Done (300 ms trailing edge, per action name) | Rapid-click spam is real friction; one choke point |
| Cross-session state persistence (replay restores tabs/switches) | Not doing | Replay-reset is the more correct default (the model has already updated the UI with a new fence); state survives naturally during streaming |
| MCP adapter / standalone gallery page / i18n | Not doing | No cross-tool demand signal; gallery material is covered by `gallery.ts` + demo-prompts + README screenshots; only 6 built-in strings |

Unit tests and builds use the locked published dsh rc.8 packages. `DSH_ROOT` is only needed by source-level or end-to-end checks.
