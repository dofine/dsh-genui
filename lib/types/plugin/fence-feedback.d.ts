/**
 * Fence feedback loop (issue #160): a reply whose ```dsh-ui fence the guard
 * cannot render should not stay broken for the reader. The host's
 * `agent/turn-stopping` boundary lets a plugin steer input into the SAME turn —
 * the machine re-reads its inbox and runs another step instead of closing
 * (see the `dsh-agent` runtime contract) — so the model can resend a corrected
 * fence while the user is still looking at the raw JSON.
 *
 * The loop is deliberately narrow, matching the contract agreed on the issue:
 * - **默认开启。** 插件配置中的 `fenceFeedback: false` 可以关闭回合转向。
 * - **修正上限。** 每个 turn 最多发送两条 correction；render failure 和 delivery reminder 共用上限，
 *   每个 fence body 在当前回合中最多修正一次，新回合可重新修正。
 * - **仅含 reasoning 的恢复。** 已验证的 GenUI 回合若只以 reasoning block 结束，使用宿主的
 *   `EMPTY_RESPONSE` retry policy。
 * - **Never for subagents.** A child session's fence belongs to a parent reply.
 * - **Exact fence matching.** Only an info string of exactly `dsh-ui` opens a
 *   fence, so ` ```dsh-ui-dark `, indented prose, or a mention of the name is
 *   never rewritten.
 * - **Accounted before sending.** The fingerprint is recorded before `steer`,
 *   so a re-entrant boundary cannot deliver the same correction twice.
 * - **Cancellation-aware.** An aborted turn or a missing session is left alone.
 *
 * 检查会复用 renderer 在回合结束后的流程，包括 JSON 修复和坏节点清理；
 * 已经可以渲染的最终回复不会收到修正请求。
